## Description
```
I am a security professional at a large organization. Part of my job is to investigate security issues to help keep the system secure. I recently discovered some potential security issues that involve login attempts and employee machines.

My task is to examine the organization’s data in their employees and log_in_attempts tables. I’ll need to use SQL filters to retrieve records from different datasets and investigate the potential security issues.
